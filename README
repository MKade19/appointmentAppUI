Front-end (Vue or React)
Design is not a very important part, but you should provide a clean and simple interface. You can use any component library.

You should provide login, main, customers, employees, departments, pages.
	Main page has a list of Appointments.
All pages (except login) should have a layout (header -- show current user, footer -- show copyright and current year).

Create/update operations with appointments should work in real time. For example, if we open the app in two different browsers, then we should see changes without page reload in each browser.

Provide pagination for lists: Customers, Appointments.
